## Overview
This project is a responsive article preview card that adapts to different screen sizes.  
It includes a share icon that displays social media links when clicked, providing a small interactive behavior to the component.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.  
- See social media share links when they click the share icon.
